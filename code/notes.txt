== Code ==
Code is a bit of a mess. 


print_image_sizes.py
	Simple script to extract the sizes of all source training images

create_targets.py
	For each training view, create corresponding masks of the 10 classes as pngs
	filename = {iid}_C{class_type}.png
	These masks are the same size as the '3' type images.
	Also create pretty colored composite of all 10 classes, "{iid}_C0.png"


dstl_utils.py
	Various utility routines and data for manipulating the dstl dataset. 



== Notes ==

TensorFlow dimension ordering convention is "Width-Height-Depth"
image_dim_ordering='tf'



width, height, in_depth, layer_depth, out_depth, layers, scales, dropout,
